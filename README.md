Awesome Terms of Service / Privacy Policies

Which you're building your own SaaS or even creating a simple website, the list of things to consider for your own terms of service is daunting. When you're just starting out and bootstrapping your company, getting a lawyer to draft a ToS can be a large expense! Jump-starting the process with permissively-licensed, previously-lawyered, established terms can save us a lot of time and expense! Copy-Paste and modify the parts you like, have your lawyer review, and [bob's your uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle).

This is a collection of openly-licensed Terms of Service / Use, and Privacy Policies. When possible, I try to link directly to the policy on GitHub, otherwise to the page on the website.
