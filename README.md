Awesome Terms of Service / Privacy Policies

Which you're building your own SaaS or even creating a simple website, the list of things to consider for your own terms of service is daunting. When you're just starting out and bootstrapping your company, getting a lawyer to draft a ToS can be a large expense! Jump-starting the process with un-copyrighted, previously-lawyered, existing terms can save us a lot of time and expense!

This is a collection of openly-licensed Terms of Service / Use, and Privacy Policies. When possible, I try to link directly to the policy on GitHub, otherwise to the page on the website.
